Requirements Document: NFT Mint Contract

1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for an NFT mint contract designed to mint image - based NFTs.The contract will be deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.

2. NFT Characteristics

    * Type: Image NFTs.
* Attributes:  NFTs will possess unique properties or attributes(further details to be specified).

3. Minting Process

    * Type: Pre - approved(whitelist) minting.
* Control: Further details on controlling the minting process(price, time limits, maximum mints per wallet, etc.) will be added in a subsequent iteration.


4. Blockchain

    * Platform: Ethereum


5. Open Issues

    * Specific details regarding NFT attributes need to be defined.
* Specific controls over the whitelist minting process(price, limits, etc.) need to be defined.



Do you approve this draft, or would you like to add or modify any of the requirements ?`
